# Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 on Annual Personal Income in the United States

## Overview

This Machine Learning project aims to explore and analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on annual personal income in the United States. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVC, to predict the impact of COVID-19 on personal income based on data from the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. The dataset contains information on various factors such as age, education, and occupation, which will be used to understand how these factors contribute to the changes in personal income during the pandemic.

## Goals

- Analyze the trends and patterns in annual personal income from 2019 to 2021.
- Predict the impact of COVID-19 on personal income using machine learning algorithms.
- Identify the key factors that significantly influence income changes during the pandemic.
- Provide insights into the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on different demographic groups.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of individual incomes from the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Each record includes the following attributes:

- Age: Age of the individual.
- Education: Education level, categorized into groups (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's, etc.).
- Occupation: The occupation of the individual.
- Income 2019: Annual personal income in 2019.
- Income 2020: Annual personal income in 2020.
- Income 2021: Annual personal income in 2021.

The dataset is collected from official government sources and surveys and provides a representative sample of the population.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the data to gain insights into income trends and patterns during the pandemic. Visualize the data to identify correlations and potential factors affecting income changes.

3. Model Building: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVC to build predictive models for income impact analysis.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.

5. Feature Importance: Identify the key features (age, education, occupation, etc.) that have the most significant impact on income changes.

6. Interpretation: Provide meaningful interpretations of the results and draw conclusions about the impact of COVID-19 on personal income.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saikk9834/Exploring-the-Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Annual-Personal-Income-in-the-United-States.git
cd Exploring-the-Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Annual-Personal-Income-in-the-United-States.git
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Usage

1. Open any of the Jupyter Notebooks in your Jupyter environment.

2. Execute the notebook cells one by one to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and build the machine learning models.

3. Explore the visualizations and analyze the trends in annual personal income.

4. Run the model evaluation and feature importance cells to understand the impact of COVID-19 on personal income.
